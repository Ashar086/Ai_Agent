    Enters text into multiple DOM elements using a bulk operation.

    This function enters text into multiple DOM elements using a bulk operation.

    It takes a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains a 'query_selector' and 'text' pair.

    The function internally calls the 'entertext' function to perform the text entry operation for each entry.

    Args:

        entries: List of objects, each containing 'query_selector' and 'text'.

    Returns:

        List of dictionaries, each containing 'query_selector' and the result of the operation.

    Enters text into a DOM element identified by a CSS selector.

    This function enters the specified text into a DOM element identified by the given CSS selector.

    It uses the Playwright library to interact with the browser and perform the text entry operation.

    The function supports both direct setting of the 'value' property and simulating keyboard typing.

    Args:

        entry (EnterTextEntry): An object containing 'query_selector' (DOM selector query using mmid attribute)

                                and 'text' (text to enter on the element).

    Returns:

    Example:

        entry = EnterTextEntry(query_selector='#username', text='test_user')

        result = await entertext(entry)

    Note:

        - The 'query_selector' should be a valid CSS selector that uniquely identifies the target element.

        - The 'text' parameter specifies the text to be entered into the element.

        - The function uses the PlaywrightManager to manage the browser instance.

        - If no active page is found, an error message is returned.

        - The function internally calls the 'do_entertext' function to perform the text entry operation.

        - The 'do_entertext' function applies a pulsating border effect to the target element during the operation.

        - The 'use_keyboard_fill' parameter in 'do_entertext' determines whether to simulate keyboard typing or not.

        - If 'use_keyboard_fill' is set to True, the function uses the 'page.keyboard.type' method to enter the text.

        - If 'use_keyboard_fill' is set to False, the function uses the 'custom_fill_element' method to enter the text.
